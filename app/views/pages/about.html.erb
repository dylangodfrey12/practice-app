     <h4 class="text-padding">Our Story... </h4>
    <p class="card-text text-padding">We are a team of developers that met at Penn State. We organized clubs, hackathons and competitions. Eventually we started to code together and complete various local projects. Ultimately, weâ€™ve decided it was time to expand our knowledge to a marketplace. Our expertise makes us perfect for large scale developing. We are majoring in computer science, software engineering, graphic design and entrepreneurship! Moreover, we are a team with chemistry and bring enthusiasm to every project! We love the daily challenges from developing and helping clients reach their goals. Hopefully, we can help you too!</p>
